Given two numbers a and b, you have to print all the prime numbers between them (including them).
Note: a will always be less than b.
Note: You have to reuse the checkPrime function created earlier

```js
function printPrime(a,b){
// write your code here
}

let a = 17;
let b = 30;
printPrime(a,b);
```
//output should be
/*
17
19
23
29
*/
