# Knight Multiple Moves

One of the chess soliders is the `Knight`. A knight can move 2 squares vertically and one horizontally or 2 sqaures horizontally and one vertically.

If a chess is placed in cell `A1`, write a function called `squaresCoveredInMoves` which calculates how many squares the knight can cover in a given number of moves.  

For example, starting from cell `A1`, then it can cover 3 squares which are `[A1, B3, C2]`as shown her:

```js
function squaresCoveredInMoves(moves){
  //Write your code here
}
```

Note: The starting cell of the knight is always `A1`.
