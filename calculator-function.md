# Calculator Function
Create a calculator function that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.
Your function will accept three parameters:
- The first and second parameter should be numbers.
- The third parameter should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

Note: If the sign does not belong to the list of operations above, a message "unknown operator" must be returned.

// Example:
```js

calculator(1,2,"+"); //=> result will be 3
calculator(1,2,"&"); //=> result will be "unknown operator"
calculator(1,2,"*"); //=> result will be 2
calculator(4,2,"/"); //=> result will be 2

```
