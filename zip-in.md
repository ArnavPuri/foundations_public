## Zip in Challenge - Should do the zip it challenge first!

Write a function called `zipIn` that takes an array of sorted arrays (2D Array) and return a single array with all of the elements within the arrays sorted in ascending order.

For e.g.
#### Example 1

```js
zipIn([
    [1,5,3,0],
    [],
    [4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 6]
    ])
```
should return `[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9]` and should console log the following:


#### Example 2
```js
zipIn([
    [2,7,3,5],
    [1],
    [0,1,301,3]
    ])
```
should return `[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 301 ]`


```js
function zipIn(arrays){
    // write your code here
}
```
