# Shift Method
## Tasks
- Create an array called `vowels` and store the five vowels (a, e, i, o, and u, in the same order) into it.
- Using the `.shift` and `.push` methods remove the vowel at the beginning of the array and place it at the end.
- Using the `.pop` and `.unshift` method remove the vowel at the end and place it again at the beginning.
