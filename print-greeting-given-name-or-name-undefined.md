Given a person's name print the appropriate greeting.

- If the name is undefined, just print the greeting "Good Morning"
- If the name is mentioned (eg. Mark) , print "Good Morning, Mark"

```js
let name = "Mark";
// write your code here
```

For example:
- If the first line is `let name = "Maahi;"` then the code should print `Good Morning, Maahi`
- If the first line is `let name;"` then the code should print `Good Morning, Maahi`
