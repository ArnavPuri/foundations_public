Part 2

Write a function called 'addTotalsToGrid' which takes an array of 3 subarrays, where each sub-array has 4 numbers. The function should add the total to the end of each sub-array and returns the array. You should call the function `addTotal` in Part 1 three times.

Tip: To start, create a variable called 'sub' and point it to the first element in the given array.

```js
// copy your add total function here

function addTotalsToGrid(grid){
// write your code here
}
let myGrid = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 0, 1, 0], [10, 12, 5, 10]];
console.log(addTotalsToGrid(myGrid));
```
