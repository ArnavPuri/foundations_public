Note: Your function formatWeatherReport **must call the functions you wrote earlier**
 - ie. convertToEmojiFace and formatTemperatureAsString

[Please refer to this diagram while writing the code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/McLarenCollege/public_images/main/dc41e5976e1acf77.png)


```js
// Copy the convertToEmoji function you wrote earlier here:

// Copy the convertToFahrenheit function you wrote earlier here:

// Copy the formatTemperatureAsString function you wrote earlier here:

// Write your new formatWeatherReport function here:


let msgForRajOnMonday = formatWeatherReport('Vancouver', 3, true);
console.log(msgForRajOnMonday);

let msgForTonyOnMonday = formatWeatherReport('Sydney', 17, false);
console.log(msgForTonyOnMonday);

let msgForJohnOnSunday = formatWeatherReport('Miami', 40, true);
console.log(msgForJohnOnSunday);
