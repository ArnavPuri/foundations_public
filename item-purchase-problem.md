### Item Purchase Problem

Given a persons bankBalance and an item's price write the code to check if a purchase can be made for the item. Your code should print the following messages :

On successful purchase : print "Payment successful. Your new balance is $***"

On purchase failure : print "Payment unsuccessful. Insufficient funds."

```js
let bankBalance = 260.50;
let price = 52.50;
// write your code here
```

### Example of if-else
As a useful reference when writing your code above, here is an example of an if-else statement:

```js
let age = 21;

if (age >= 21) {
  console.log("Can vote");
} 
else {
  console.log("Cannot vote");
}
```
