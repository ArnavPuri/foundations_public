The passing score is the minimum score needed for a student to pass a subject.
Given the passing score and a student's scores in maths, physics and chemistry, 
write a boolean expression to determine if a student has passed all subjects.

```JS
let passingScore = 75;
let mathsScore = 81;
let physicsScore = 75;
let chemistryScore = 88;

// write your boolean expression on the line below
let passedAllSubjects = ; 

console.log(passedAllSubjects);
```
