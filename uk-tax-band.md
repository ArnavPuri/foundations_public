# Calcuate Tax Amount
Here are the [UK tax bands](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) for 2021 as described by the UK tax authority:

Taxable Income | Tax Rate
---------------|--------:
£0 to £12,500  | 0%
£12,501 to £50,000  | 20%
£50,001 to £150,000  | 40%
over £150,000  | 45%

Given the taxable income amount, write the code the tax amount based 
on the above table.  

For example,
```js
let taxableIncome = 10000;
let taxAmount =  0
```
```js
let taxableIncome = 12600;
let taxAmount =   20
```
```js
let taxableIncome = 51000;
let taxAmount =  7900
```
```js
let taxableIncome = 180000;
let taxAmount =  61000
```
Exercises :

```js
let taxableIncome = 20000;
let taxAmount = ;
```
```js
let taxableIncome = 50010;
let taxAmount = ;//
```
```js
let taxableIncome = 155000;
let taxAmount = ;//
```
